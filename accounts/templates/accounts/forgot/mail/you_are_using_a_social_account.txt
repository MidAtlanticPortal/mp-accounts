Dear {{ name }},

Our records indicate that this email address used {{ auth_provider_name }} to sign in. When using {{ auth_provider_name }} to sign in, you are not required to enter a password. 

To log in, go to {{ site_url }} and click on "LOG IN" (on the upper-right side of the screen), and click on the "Sign in with {{ auth_provider_name }}" button. 

During this process you may be asked to enter your {{ auth_provider_name }} account password. 

If you did not request this, then no action is required.
